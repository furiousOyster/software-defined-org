# software-defined-orgs
Infrastructure is better as software.  Organizations too.

# Features
Orgs ultimately have features that matter to their users.  Users of an org are:
1. Customers
5. Staff
3. Shareholders

# Data
As software is used, it creates data.  Data MAY be mixed with logic in some circumstances.  In this case, we separate the configuration of the org from the running data, but use the same repository.

# Issues
Tickets serve two purposes here:
1. Highlighting faults in the configuration or performance of the org
1. Highlighting faults in the execution of the org - ie: the data contained within the org
