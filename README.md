Radio is better as software.  Networking is better as software. Infrastructure is better as software.  Organizations is better as software.

## Factions of an Org
This file and the folder [_software-defined-org](./_software-defined-org/README.md) is what results from forking the base repo and begining to operate a faction or an org, or a complete org in one place.  
Factions arise due to the separation needs of an organization, such as HR files, and other sensitive documents, as well as opening up pieces to external contractors, and other such requirements.

## Your Faction
You should replace this file with a description of your faction and what it does, as well as a diagram that highlights which faction yours is on the production line.
