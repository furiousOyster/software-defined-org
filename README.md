# software-defined-orgs
Infrastructure is better as software.  Organizations too.

# Features
Orgs ultimately have features that matter to their users.  Users of an org are:
1. Customers
5. Staff
3. Shareholders

# Data
As software is used, it creates data.  Data MAY be mixed with logic in some circumstances.  In this case, we separate the configuration of the org from the running data, but use the same repository.

# Issues
Tickets serve two purposes here:
1. Highlighting faults in the configuration or performance of the org.  This will include requests for new features / capabilities of the org
1. Highlighting faults in the execution of the org - ie: the data contained within the org

# Changelog
Each sprint close, we publish a changelog describing the changes that have been applied in the last sprint in two parts:
1. Changes to the org config
1. Changes to the execution of the org: ie: the data that changed within the org

# Roadmap
Here we describe what features of the org will be delivered when, what features are in progress, and briefly describe why they are need.  We also talk about what features will see sunset.

# UNSORTED
## Interbit modelled using git
Any interbit system can be modeled using github repo permissions, issues, and git commits.

> `issues === actions`

> `commits === blocks`

> `prs, branches, merges === chain forks and merges`

> `git submodules === read joins`

> `ability to create issues === write join access`

Revenue is generated ONLY by apps.  Apps are not built by BTL.  Apps need an environment around them to allow their production.  BTL resources are only deployed on things that support the production of the highest revenue generating apps, and nothing else.

## A note on humanity
It is very important to draw the distinction between the functions required by the organization, and the human beings supplying those functions.  The functions are cold and precise, but the humans warm and approximate.  We encourage humans to rotate functions periodically, and value most continual improvement in clean execution of function, and strict adherence to the cross function API that makes the organization work.
