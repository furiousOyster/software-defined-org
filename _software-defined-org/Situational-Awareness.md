# Situational Awareness
Awareness of what our competitors are doing, what our customers are doing, and what we think both groups will do next is key to survival.  The types of competitor and customer can be represented as a series of circles.

This is another funnelling process, where we need to take a huge amount of data, and reduce it down to timely, meaningful, summaries and extracts.  The top of the funnel is a list of every possible option, then as things move through the pipeline, increasing studious effort is expended to learn about them.

## Required areas of awareness:

1. List of failed PoCs
   - what chain they used
   - how much it cost
   - why it failed
   - how they planned to scale
   
1. List of companies that have a blockchain lab
   - how many staff
   - skill level
   - how much funding
   - what projects are they doing    - what chains are they familiar with
   - what PoCs have they done 
   
1. Canadian Public Junior blockchain companies (apps or platforms)
   - Market cap
   - history of cap / stock trend
   - correlation to bitcoin
   - list of analysts that view their stock, and their reports
   - eg: TSXV:HIVE
   
1. Large corporations with a blockchain initiative
   - eg: IBM, Microsoft, Mastercard, JPMorgan
   - same tests as blockchain lab assessment, plus:
   - how much is the company language pointing torwards blockchain ?
   - how essential is the company making blockchain ?
   - in their quarterly reports, how much money was dedicated to blockchain ?
   - what blockchain revenue have they booked ?
