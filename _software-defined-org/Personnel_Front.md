### Relationship between timelines and horizon
The ability to grant holiday bookings is linked solely to the two key timelines of the Org:  The Sales timeline and the Supply timeline.  If either of those timelines would be negatively impacted by the absence of the requester, we cannot normally grant holidays.

The planning horizon of those two timelines affects the booking horizon for holidays, as we cannot book holidays further in the future than either of those timelines can see.

Furthermore, there may be periods where the timelines are at risk - these will be indicated by rolling back the planning horizon and has the same net affect of freezing holidays, by being unable to book them.
