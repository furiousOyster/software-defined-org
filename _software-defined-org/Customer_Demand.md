# Customer Demand


## Partners
Good Partners have many customers and a pipeline of prospects.  
Good Partners have expertise about specific domains and the typical prospect's "pains and gains".
Good Partners have direct access to decision makers at customers and prospects.
Good partners would be motivated by opportunities to use our products/tech to help their customers IF it results in revenues/profits above a certain size for them.
 
Identifying good partners is the beginning of a process that would put our people "in the same room" as the end users our products have to serve, allowing us to validate our assumptions, learn and make appropriate adjustments to our product offerings, messaging and positioning.
