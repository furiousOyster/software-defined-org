# Sales Leads

## Mining Analogy: 
? Geological prospecting - basically something could be here, we want to explore before commiting to production mining.

# Contacts
Contact cards of all entities that are being contacted are shared between all functions.  Some of those cards are used in other areas, such as industry surveys, supplied information and management, etc

# Roll up into revenue projections
The whole sales pipeline should have standard forecasts for expected revenue in each quarter, and a 3 level rating of likelihood.  This will feed up into the company revenue projects of best, worst, expected.

# Accountability of forecasts
If a forecast does not come to pass, what happens ?
