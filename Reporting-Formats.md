# Reporting Formats

## Submission mechanisms
1. Each worker will make a pull request against their managers branch with their update for the day.  The manager will also PR their personal report against the management branch.
1. The Manager, when satisfied, will merge into their management branch.
1. Manager will write up a summary report, summarizing all the info on the dailies, then will PR the whole thing against the next level branch.
1. Work location - where to go to see the work done - can be a range of commits, repos, or in extreme cases some tool, such as Figma for design work. 
1. Say why this was the most valuable set of things to do today ?
1. Ultimately this results in a merge to master once all reports are summarized at each level.
